# Earthquake_prediction

we aim to apply Machine Learning and Deep Learning
techniques to accurately predict the magnitude of earthquakes. The goal
of this project is to predict the magnitude of earthquake for a region given
by the user with the help historical data. This application will ask the user
to enter the range of latitude and longitude for the region where they want
to know if earthquake can occur. Based on these co-ordinates it will use
the data set and apply Regression algorithms to make the prediction. The
mean square error is also calculated so we can find which algorithm gives
accurate results
