        <h1>FORECASTING  SEISMIC  TREMORS  USING  <br>MACHINE  LEARNING  TECHNIQUES</h1> <br>
        <p class="par">An earthquake is a type of natural disaster that causes havoc to both naturally existing and artificial structures, <br>
                       including buildings, residential areas etc. Seismometers, which pick up vibrations caused by seismic waves moving <br>
                       through the earth's crust, are used to measure earthquakes. The damage caused by an earthquake is categorized in <br>
                       this work into damage ratings, which have values ranging from one to ten. An analysis of current machine learning <br>
                       classifier techniques is being used to make the forecast of earthquake. Machine learning algorithms like Logistic <br>
                       Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest Classifier these algorithms are employed in the prediction <br>
                       of the earthquake. After studying all the above used algorithms in that the best algorithm will be taken into consideration. <br>
                       Proposed implementation uses two types of datasets. Results are tabulated, both algorithms achieve good accuracy, but their <br>
                       application in real situations can be based on the trade-off between speed and accuracy. <br> <br>
                       This project is to predict the magnitude of earthquake for a region given by the user with the help historical data. As we <br>
                       know that the destruction caused by earthquakes is massive and causes loss of lives every year. There is several ways Geologist <br>
                       use to predict earthquakes. The results so far have been successful in telling where an earthquake has more probability to occur <br>
                       but when it will happen is still under research. This application will ask the user to enter the range of latitude and longitude <br>
                       for the region where they want to know if earthquake can occur. Based on these co-ordinates it will use the data set and apply <br> 
                       Regression algorithms to make the prediction. The mean square error is also calculated so we can find which algorithm gives accurate results. </p>
